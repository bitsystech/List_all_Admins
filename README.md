# List_all_Admins
This script will echo the list of all admins on a Mac. Considering UID of admin account is >500

Pretty simple script. 
First it checks all users and then I awked only the users who have ID >=500
Then list all such usersnames
To get the list of all such usernames, I had to put in a small trick (this is help of some online script that I dont remember where I got from but it is in my head.
